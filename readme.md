# Hubbub: Test Save This Actions and Filters

A sample WordPress plugin that adds example actions and filters for Hubbub's Save This feature. The Hubbub team uses this plugin to test Hubbub Pro. See the List of Actions and List of Filters below for a full list of what is currently supported.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.3 or above
- PHP 7.2.x
- Hubbub Pro 2.23.0 or above

## List of Actions and Filters

All currently supported actions are in [_actions.php](https://github.com/nerdpressteam/hubbub-test-save-this-filters/blob/main/_actions.php) and filters are in [_filters.php](https://github.com/nerdpressteam/hubbub-test-save-this-filters/blob/main/_filters.php).

For a description of each action and filter [see our Support Doc](https://morehubbub.com/docs/save-this-filters/)

## Examples

We've also included a few fun and pratical examples in [examples.php](https://github.com/nerdpressteam/hubbub-test-save-this-filters/blob/main/examples.php) that may be useful or inspire an idea of how these might be used.
